üìù Repository Description
This project presents an interactive E-Commerce Sales Analysis Dashboard built using Microsoft Excel, designed to uncover insights from transactional sales data of a fictional superstore. The goal is to help business stakeholders identify patterns, trends, and areas of opportunity by analyzing product performance, regional impact, customer segmentation, and overall profitability.

üìä Purpose
With increasing market competition, understanding what products, customer segments, or regions contribute most to business growth is essential. This dashboard allows users to quickly grasp:

Which product categories or sub-categories generate the highest and lowest profits.

Which customer segments (e.g., Consumer, Corporate, Home Office) are most valuable.

How regions (Central, East, South, West) perform in terms of sales and profit.

State-wise distribution of sales to uncover regional opportunities or underperformance.

Year-over-year growth in sales, quantity, and profit margin.

üîç Key Features
Sales and Profit Trend: Monthly visualization of both sales and profit, helping track seasonality or anomalies.

Profit Margin and Quantity Sold: Highlights profitability and quantity growth year-over-year.

Category-Wise Profit and Share: Breakdown of revenue and profit across product categories and sub-categories.

Sales by Segment & Region: Comparative analysis across customer segments and geographical regions.

Interactive Filters: Users can filter by Segment, Region, and Year to explore more specific insights.

Map Visualization: Displays state-wise sales distribution for geographical targeting.

üóÇÔ∏è Dataset Overview
The dataset contains key business attributes:

Order Details: Order ID, Order Date, Ship Date, Ship Mode

Customer Info: Customer ID, Customer Name, Segment, Country, City, State, Postal Code, Region

Product Info: Product ID, Category, Sub-Category, Product Name

Metrics: Sales, Quantity, Discount, Profit

This dataset allows for additional exploration, including predictive modeling (e.g., regression for profit or sales forecasting), though this project focuses on descriptive and diagnostic analysis.
